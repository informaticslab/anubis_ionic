<p>Often several acceptable ways of writing a cause-of-death statement exist.
Optimally, a certifier will be able to provide a simple description of the
process leading to death that is etiologically clear and be confident that
this is the correct sequence of causes. However, realistically, description of
the process is sometimes difficult because the certifier is not certain.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the certifier should think through the causes about which
he/she is confident and what possible etiologies could have resulted in
these conditions. The certifier should select the causes that are suspected
to have been involved and use words such as ‘‘probable’’ or ‘‘presumed’’ to
indicate that the description provided is not completely certain. If the
initiating condition reported on the death certificate could have arisen
from a pre-existing condition, but the certifier cannot determine the etiology,
he/she should state that the etiology is unknown, undetermined, or
unspecified, so it is clear that the certifier did not have enough information
to provide even a qualified etiology. Reporting a cause of death as unknown
should be a last resort.
