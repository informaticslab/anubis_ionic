						In addition to the series of handbooks, additional resources include manuals,
			guidelines, and Web sites (7â€“15). Resources on completing death certificates
			should be kept with or near blank death certificates for easy
			reference. Additional copies of government-produced resources are available
			from the State vital statistics offices, the National Center for Health
			Statistics, and the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs (under vital statistics,
			mortality, writing cause-of-death statements).
