		<span class="section-title">48-year-old Male with Cramping</span>
		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>Shortly after dinner on the day prior to admission to the hospital, this
			48-year-old male developed a cramping, epigastric pain, which radiated to
			his back, followed by nausea and vomiting. The pain was not relieved by
			positional changes or antacids. The pain persisted, and 24 hours after its
			onset, the patient sought medical attention. He had a 10-year history of
			excessive alcohol consumption and a 2-year history of frequent episodes of
			similar epigastric pain. The patient denied diarrhea, constipation, hematemesis,
			or melena. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis
			of an acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis. Radiological findings
			included a duodenal ileus and pancreatic calcification. Serum amylase
			was 4,032 units per liter. The day after admission, the patient seemed to
			improve. However, that evening he became disoriented, restless, and hypotensive.
			Despite intravenous fluids and vasopressors, the patient remained
			hypotensive and died. Autopsy findings revealed many areas of
			fibrosis in the pancreas with the remaining areas showing multiple foci of
			acute inflammation and necrosis.

			Notes on death certification:<br/>
			Duodenal ileus and pancreatic calcification are nonspecific processes and
			neither could be listed as an underlying cause of death.
