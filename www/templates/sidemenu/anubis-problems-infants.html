			<p>
			The infant decedent should have a clear and distinct etiological sequence
			for cause of death, if possible. ‘‘Prematurity’’ should not be entered without
			explaining the etiology of prematurity. Maternal conditions may have initiated
			or affected the sequence that resulted in infant death, and such
			maternal causes should be reported in addition to the infant causes on the
			infant’s death certificate (e.g., hyaline membrane disease due to prematurity,
			28 weeks due to placental abruption due to blunt trauma to mother’s
			abdomen).
			</p>
			<p>
			When Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is suspected, a complete
			investigation should be conducted, typically by a medical examiner or
			coroner. If the infant is under 1 year of age, no cause of death is determined
			after scene investigation, review of clinical history, and a complete
			autopsy. The death then can be reported as SIDS. Refer to the Medical
			Examiners’ and Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death
			Reporting for more information.
