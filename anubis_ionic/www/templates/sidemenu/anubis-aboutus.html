		<span class="section-paragraph">This handbook is designed to acquaint physicians, medical students, and
			others with the vital registration system in the United States and to provide
			instructions for completing and filing death certificates. Emphasis is
			directed toward the certification of medical information, the primary responsibility
			of the physician, and a critical piece of information on the
			death certificate.

		<span class="section-paragraph">
				The death certificate is a permanent record of the fact of death, and
				depending on the State of death, may be needed to get a burial permit.
				State law specifies the required time for completing and filing the death
				certificate.
				The death certificate provides important personal information about the
				decedent and about the circumstances and cause of death. This information
				has many uses related to the settlement of the estate and provides
				family members closure, peace of mind, and documentation of the cause of
				death.
				The death certificate is the source for State and national mortality statistics
				(figures 1–3) and is used to determine which medical conditions receive
				research and development funding, to set public health goals, and to
				measure health status at local, State, national, and international levels.
				The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for
				Health Statistics (NCHS) publishes summary mortality data in the National
				Vital Statistics Report publication ‘‘Deaths: Final data’’ and on the
				Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs (under vital statistics, mortality).
