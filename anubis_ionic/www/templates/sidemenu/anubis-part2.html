    <span class="page-title">Part II of the cause of death section (other significant conditions)</span>
    <hr class="hr"/>
    <span class="section-title">Purpose</span>
    <span class="section-paragraph">
<p>
All other important diseases or conditions that were present at the time of
death and that may have contributed to the death, but did not lead to the
underlying cause of death listed in Part I or were not reported in the chain
of events in Part I, should be recorded on these lines. (More than one
condition can be reported per line in Part II.)
</p>
<p>
Multiple conditions and sequences of conditions resulting in death are
common, particularly among the elderly. When there are two or more
possible sequences resulting in death, or if two conditions seem to have
added together, choose and report in Part I the sequence thought to have
had the greatest impact. Other conditions or conditions from the other
sequence(s) should be reported in Part II. For example, in the case of a
diabetic male with chronic ischemic heart disease who dies from pneumonia,
his certifying physician must choose the sequence of conditions that
had the greatest impact and report this sequence in Part I. One possible
sequence that the certifier might report would be pneumonia due to diabetes
mellitus in Part I with chronic ischemic heart disease reported in
Part II. Another possibility would be pneumonia due to the chronic ischemic
heart disease entered in Part I with diabetes mellitus reported in
Part II. Or the certifier might consider the pneumonia to be due to the
ischemic heart disease that was due to the diabetes mellitus and report
this entire sequence in Part I. Because these three different possibilities
would be coded very differently, it is important for the certifying physician
to decide which sequence most accurately describes the conditions causing
death.
</p>
<b>
Doubt and cause of death</b>
<p>
In cases of doubt, it may be necessary to use qualifying phrases in either
Part I or Part II to reflect uncertainty as to which conditions led to death. In
cases where the certifier is unable to establish a cause of death based
upon reasonable medical certainty, he or she should enter ‘‘Unknown’’ in
the cause-of-death section. However, this should be shown only after all
efforts have been made to determine the cause of death. An autopsy
should be performed, if possible.
</p>
<b>
Other items for medical certification
</b>
<p>
The remaining items that require the physician’s certification relate to
autopsy, manner of death, injury, female decedent’s pregnancy status, if
tobacco use contributed to death, and whether the case was referred to the
medical examiner or coroner.
</p>
<p>
The physician should indicate whether an autopsy was performed and
whether the findings were available to complete the cause of death. If
additional medical information or autopsy findings are received after the
physician has certified the cause of death and he or she determines the
cause to be different from what was originally entered on the death certificate,
the original certificate should be amended by filing a supplemental
report of cause of death with the State registrar. Information on the proper
form to use and procedure to follow can be obtained from the State registrar.
</p>
<p>
In most cases the manner of death will be checked ‘‘Natural.’’ In those
cases when an accident, suicide, or homicide has occurred, the medical
examiner or coroner must be notified. If the medical examiner or coroner
does not assume jurisdiction, the physician should check the appropriate
manner of death and describe the injury and accident.
</p>
<b>
Completing the certifier section
</b>
<p>
Physicians can play different roles in medical certification. A pronouncing
physician is a physician who determines that the decedent is legally dead,
but was not in charge of the patient’s care for the illness or condition that
resulted in death. The attending physician is responsible for completing
the cause-of-death section (item 32). If a pronouncing physician is involved,
the attending physician plays the role of a certifying physician. If no
pronouncing physician is involved, the attending physician plays the role
of both the pronouncing and certifying physician. The medical examiner or
coroner investigates certain types of deaths according to State law and
complete the cause of death for these cases.
</p>
<p>
The following chart specifies the items to be completed by each type of
medical certifier.

<p>
The attending physician is usually in a better position than any other
individual to make a judgment as to which of the conditions led directly to
death and to state the antecedent conditions, if any, that gave rise to this
cause.
</p>
<p>
Because the items completed by the pronouncing or pronouncing and
certifying physician, and medical examiner or coroner differ, separate
statements are provided that specify to what information each physician is
attesting. This agreement is denoted when each physician signs the completed
statement, adding his or her degree or title and license number.
Certain jurisdictions may provide for electronic authentication instead of a
signature on the paper document. The date of certification and mailing
address of the physician should also be provided.
