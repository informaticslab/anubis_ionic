		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>A 30-year-old, gravida-six, para-five, with a history of gestational hypertension,
			reported to the emergency room at 36 weeks gestation with complaints
			of abdominal cramping and light vaginal bleeding during the past
			12 hours. At time of first assessment, fetal heart tones were detected. The
			uterus was tense, irritable, and tender. The mother was hypotensive with
			tachycardia. A presumptive diagnosis of abruptio placenta was made, and
			an emergency cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia.
			The baby was stillborn. The mother continued to bleed from her uterus
			and phlebotomy sites and went into profound shock secondary to disseminated
			intravascular coagulation. Despite administration of blood and clotting
			factors, intravascular pressure could not be maintained, and the mother
			died on the operating table. Maternal autopsy confirmed the clinical
			diagnosis.
			A death certificate would be completed for the mother and a fetal death
			report for the fetus. The cause of fetal death is reported using a different
			format. Please refer to the Medical Examiners’ and Coroners’ Handbook on
			Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting for further information. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<i>
			Notes on death certification:<br/>
			In this case, gestational hypertension would be considered a factor that
			contributed to the death. However, it would not be in the direct causal
			sequence of Part I, so it would be placed in Part II.
