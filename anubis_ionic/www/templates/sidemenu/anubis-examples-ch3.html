		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>This 75-year-old male was admitted to the hospital complaining of severe
			chest pain. He had a 10-year history of arteriosclerotic heart disease with
			EKG findings of myocardial ischemia and several episodes of congestive
			heart failure controlled by digitalis preparations and diuretics. Five months
			before this admission, the patient was found to be anemic, with an hematocrit
			of 17, and to have occult blood in the stool. A barium enema revealed
			a large polypoid mass in the cecum diagnosed as carcinoma by biopsy.
			Because of the patientâ€™s cardiac status, he was not considered to be a
			surgical candidate. Instead, he was treated with a 5-week course of radiation
			therapy and periodic packed red cell transfusions. He completed this
			course 3 months before this hospital admission. On this admission the
			EKG was diagnostic of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. He
			expired 2 days later.

			Notes on death certification:<br/>
			Acute myocardial infarction, listed in Part I line (a) as the immediate cause
			of death, is a direct consequence of arteriosclerotic heart disease, the underlying
			cause listed in Part I line (b).
			Carcinoma of cecum is listed in Part II because it caused anemia and
			weakened the patient, but it did not cause arteriosclerotic heart disease.
			Congestive heart failure is listed in Part II because it also weakened the
			patient. Although it was caused by the arteriosclerotic heart disease, it was
			not part of the causal sequence leading to the acute myocardial infarction.
