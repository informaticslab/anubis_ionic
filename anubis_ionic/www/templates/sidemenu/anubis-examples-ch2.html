		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>A 68-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with progressive right
			lower quadrant pain of several weeksâ€™ duration. The patient had lost approximately
			40 pounds, with progressive weakness and malaise. On physical
			examination, the patient had an enlarged liver span that was four
			finger breadths below the right costal margin. Rectal examination was
			normal and stool was negative for occult blood. Routine laboratory studies
			were within normal limits. A chest x ray and barium enema were negative.
			His EKG showed a right bundle branch block. CT scan showed numerous
			masses within both lobes of the liver. A needle biopsy of the liver was
			diagnostic of moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and the
			patient was started on chemotherapy. Three months after the diagnosis,
			the patient developed sharp diminution of liver function as well as a deep
			venous thrombosis of his left thigh, and he was admitted to the hospital.
			On his third day, the patient developed a pulmonary embolism and died 30
			minutes later.
