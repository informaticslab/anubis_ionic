		<span class="section-title">75-year-old Female with History of Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Myocardial Ingfraction</span>
		<span class="section-paragraph">
<p>A 75-year-old female had a 15-year history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, a 13-year history of mild hypertension treated with thiazide
diuretics, and an uncomplicated myocardial infarction 6 years prior to the
present illness. She was found disoriented in her apartment and brought
to the hospital. On admission she was noted to be unresponsive, without
focal neurologic signs, and severely dehydrated with a blood pressure of
90/60. Initial laboratory tests disclosed severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity,
azotemia, and mild ketosis without acidosis. A diagnosis of hyperosmolar
nonketotic coma was made.
The patient was vigorously treated with fluids, electrolytes, insulin, and
broad-spectrum antibiotics, although no source for infection was documented.
Within 72 hours, the patientâ€™s hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic state
was resolved. However, she remained anuric with progressive azotemia.
Attempts at renal dialysis were unsuccessful, and the patient died on the
8th hospital day in severe renal failure.

<i>
Notes on death certification:<br/>
In this case, hypertension and a previous myocardial infarction would both
be considered factors that contributed to the death. However, they would
not be in the direct causal sequence of Part I, so they would be placed in
Part II.
