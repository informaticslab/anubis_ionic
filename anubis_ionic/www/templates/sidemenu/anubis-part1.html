    <span class="page-title">Part I of the cause of death section</span>
    <hr class="hr"/>
    <span class="section-title">Purpose</span>
    <span class="section-paragraph">

<p>      Only one cause is to be entered on each line of Part I. Additional lines
should be added between the printed lines when necessary. For each
cause, indicate in the space provided the approximate interval between the
date of onset (not necessarily the date of diagnosis) and the date of death.
For clarity, do not use parenthetical statements and abbreviations when
reporting the cause of death. The underlying cause of death should be
entered on the LOWEST LINE USED IN PART I. The underlying cause of
death is the disease or injury that started the sequence of events leading
directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that
produced the fatal injury. In the case of a violent death, the form of
external violence or accident is antecedent to an injury entered, although
the two events may be almost simultaneous.
</p>
<b>
Line (a) immediate cause</b>
<p>
In Part I, the immediate cause of death is reported on line (a). This is the
final disease, injury, or complication directly causing the death. An immediate
cause of death must always be reported on line (a). It can be the sole
entry in the cause-of-death section if that condition is the only condition
causing the death.
</p>
<p>
The immediate cause does not mean the mechanism of death or terminal
event (for example, cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest). The mechanism of
death (for example, cardiac or respiratory arrest) should not be reported as
the immediate cause of death as it is a statement not specifically related to
the disease process, and it merely attests to the fact of death. Therefore,
the mechanism of death provides no additional information on the cause
of death.
</p>

<b>Lines (b), (c), and (d) due to (or as a consequence of)</b>
<p>
On line (b) report the disease, injury, or complication, if any, that gave rise
to the immediate cause of death reported on line (a). If this in turn resulted
from a further condition, record that condition on line (c). If this in turn
resulted from a further condition, record that condition on line (d). For as
many conditions as are involved, write the full sequence, one condition per
line, with the most recent condition at the top, and the underlying cause of
death reported on the lowest line used in Part I. If more than four lines are
needed, add additional lines (writing ‘‘due to’’ between conditions on the
same line is the same as drawing an additional line) rather than using
space in Part II to continue the sequence. The following certification is an
example in which an additional line was necessary.
</p>
<p>
The words ‘‘due to (or as a consequence of),’’ which are printed between the
lines of Part I, apply not only in sequences with an etiological or pathological
basis and usually a chronological time ordering, but also to sequences
in which an antecedent condition is believed to have prepared the way for
a subsequent cause by damage to tissues or impairment of function.
If the immediate cause of death arose as a complication of or from an error
or accident in surgery or other medical procedure or treatment, it is
important to report what condition was being treated, what medical procedure
was performed, what the complication or error was, and what the
result of the complication or error was.
</p>
<b>Approximate interval between onset and death</b>
<p>
Space is provided to the right of lines (a), (b), (c), and (d) for recording the
interval between the presumed onset of the condition (not the diagnosis of
the condition) and the date of death. This should be entered for all conditions
in Part I. These intervals usually are established by the physician on
the basis of available information. In some cases the interval will have to
be estimated. The terms ‘‘unknown’’ or ‘‘approximately’’ may be used.
General terms, such as minutes, hours, or days, are acceptable, if necessary.
If the time of onset is entirely unknown, state that the interval is
‘‘Unknown.’’ Do not leave these items blank.
</p>
<p>
This information is useful in coding certain diseases and also provides a
useful check on the accuracy of the reported sequence of conditions.
