		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>A 102-year-old female was brought to the hospital because her word
			combinations were not comprehensible. However, at admission, her sentences
			were lucid. She was placed on blood anticoagulants. She had a
			history of arthritis, hypertension, blocked arteries, coronary thrombosis
			(25 years before), stroke (10 years before), periodic TIAs (8-year period),
			and congestive heart failure (hospitalized 6 years before). On the fourth
			day in the hospital, a colonoscopy indicated internal bleeding, so the
			anticoagulant was discontinued. She was released from the hospital after
			7 days. After discharge, language and motor skills were impaired although
			functioning was better earlier in the day; moreover, her leg coloration
			started changing. After a week at home, the woman was re-admitted to the
			hospital following a spell of vomiting. Vascular imaging indicated that
			circulation was blocked at the groin, there was no improvement in language,
			ability to eat and keep food down deteriorated, and heart rate
			periodically was arrythmic with periods of third-degree heart block. After a
			week of hospitalization, she was sent home under hospice care and died 2
			days later. Her attending physician completed the death certificate.
