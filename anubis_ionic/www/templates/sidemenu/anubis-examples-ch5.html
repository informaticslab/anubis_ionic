		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>
				A 78-year-old female with a temperature of 102.6° F was admitted to the
			hospital from a nursing home. She first became a resident of the nursing
			home 2 years earlier following a cerebrovascular accident, which left her
			with a residual left hemiparesis. Over the next year, she became increasingly
			dependent on others to help with her activities of daily living, eventually
			requiring an in-dwelling bladder catheter 6 months before the current
			admission. For the 3 days prior to admission, she was noted to have lost
			her appetite and to have become increasingly withdrawn.
			On admission to the hospital her leukocyte count was 19,700, she had
			pyuria, and gram-negative rods were seen on a gram stain of urine.
			Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered intravenously. On the third
			hospital day, admission blood cultures turned positive for Pseudomonas
			aeruginosa, which was resistant to ampicillin and gentamicin. Antibiotic
			therapy was changed to ticarcillin clavulanate, to which the organism was
			sensitive. Despite the antibiotics and intravenous fluid support, the patient’s
			fever persisted. On the fourth hospital day, she became hypotensive
			and died.
			This case illustrates that additional lines may be added to Part I.
