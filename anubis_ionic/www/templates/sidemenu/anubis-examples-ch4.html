		<span class="section-paragraph">
<p>A 68-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and moderate
retrosternal pain of 5-hours duration, which did not respond to nitroglycerin.
There was a past history of obesity, noninsulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, and episodes of nonexertional chest pain, diagnosed
as angina pectoris, for 8 years. Over the first 72 hours, she developed
a significant elevation of the MB isoenzyme of creatine phosphokinase,
confirming an acute myocardial infarction. A Type II second-degree AV
block developed, and a temporary pacemaker was put in place. She subsequently
developed dyspnea with fluid retention and cardiomegaly on
chest radiograph. She improved with diuretics. On the seventh hospital
day, during ambulation, she suddenly developed chest pain and increased
dyspnea. An acute pulmonary embolism was suspected and intravenous
heparin was started. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was confirmed
by a ventilation/perfusion scan as well as arterial blood gas measurements.
One hour later, she became unresponsive and resuscitation efforts
were unsuccessful.

Notes on death certification:<br/>
In this case, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension,
and congestive heart failure would all be considered factors that contributed
to the death. However, they would not be in the direct causal sequence of
Part I, so they would be placed in Part II.
