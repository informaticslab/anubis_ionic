			<p>
			The elderly decedent should have a clear and distinct etiological sequence
			for cause of death, if possible. Terms such as senescence, infirmity,
			old age, and advanced age have little value for public health or
			medical research. Age is recorded elsewhere on the certificate. When a
			number of conditions resulted in death, the physician should choose the
			single sequence that, in his or her opinion, best describes the process
			leading to death, and place any other pertinent conditions in Part II.
			‘‘Multiple system failure’’ could be included in Part II, but the systems need
			to be specified to ensure that the information is captured. If after careful
			31
			consideration, the physician cannot determine a sequence that ends in
			death, then the medical examiner or coroner should be consulted about
			conducting an investigation or providing assistance in completing the
			cause of death.
