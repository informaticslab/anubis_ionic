		<span class="section-paragraph">
<p>A 75-year-old male had a 10-year history of chronic bronchitis associated
with smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for more than 40 years. When
seen by his physician approximately 2 years prior to his terminal episode,
he had moderately reduced FEV1 and FVC with no response to bronchodilators.
During his last year, he required corticosteroids to prevent wheezing
and coughing at night; however, he was unable to reduce his smoking
to less than one pack of cigarettes per day. When seen 3 months prior to
his terminal episode, he had significantly reduced FEV1 and FVC with no
response to bronchodilators. He awoke one evening complaining to his
wife about coughing and worsening shortness of breath. He was taken to
the emergency room where he was found to have an acute exacerbation of
obstructive airway disease. He was admitted to the hospital. At the patientâ€™s
request, no mechanical ventilation was employed, and he died 12
hours later in respiratory arrest.

Notes on death certification:<br/>
In this case, respiratory arrest is considered a mechanism of death, and it
would not be listed as the Immediate Cause of Death.
