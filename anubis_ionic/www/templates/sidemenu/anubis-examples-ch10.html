		<span class="section-paragraph">
<p>A 1,480-gram male infant was born at 32-weeks gestation to a 20-year-old
primiparous woman. Newborn screening found elevated levels of immunoreactive
trypsinogen in the blood. The infant developed respiratory distress
syndrome and required mechanical ventilation for 7 days. Despite
receiving adequate calories for growth, the infant gained weight poorly and
had persistent diarrhea. Steatorrhea was confirmed upon microscopic
examination. Results from a sweat chloride test given on the 21st day after
birth were negative, but the patient had an elevated sweat chloride concentration
of 85 millimoles per liter when the test was repeated at 35 days
of age. On the 37th day after birth, the infant became lethargic and was
noted to be edematous. Escherichia coli was cultured from the infantâ€™s
cerebral spinal fluid, total serum proteins were reported to be low, and
clotting studies were prolonged. The infant died at 45 days of age despite
appropriate life-saving efforts. Gross autopsy confirmed the clinical impression
of cystic fibrosis.

Notes on death certification:<br/>
In this case, prematurity, malabsorption, respiratory distress syndrome,
and failure to thrive would all be considered factors that contributed to the
death. However, they would not be in the direct causal sequence of Part I, so
they would be placed in Part II.
