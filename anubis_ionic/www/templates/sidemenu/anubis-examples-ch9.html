		<span class="section-title">53-year-old Male with Intermittent Midpigastric, and Left-Sided Chest Pain</span>
		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>This 53-year-old male was admitted to the hospital following 2 days of
			intermittent midepigastric and left-sided chest pain. The pain radiated to
			his left arm and was accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He gave a
			history that included 2 years of occasional chest discomfort, a near syncopal
			episode 6 months prior, hypertension, a 30-year history of one-packper-day
			cigarette smoking, congenital blindness, and insulin-dependent
			diabetes mellitus. He was noted to be markedly obese and to have severe
			hypercholesterolemia.
			At the time of admission, his enzyme studies were normal, but the EKG
			suggested myocardial ischemia. Two days later, he experienced an episode
			of severe chest pain that did not respond to nitroglycerin and was accompanied
			by ST-segment elevation. A cardiac catheterization demonstrated
			severe multivessel coronary artery stenosis. He underwent quadruple coronary
			artery bypass surgery. Shortly, after being taken off the cardiopulmonary
			bypass machine, he went into cardiac arrest. As resuscitation was
			being attempted by open cardiac massage, a rupture developed in his left
			ventricular wall that resulted in rapid exsanguination and death.

			<i>
			Notes on death certification:<br/>
			In this case, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, hypertension,
			and hypercholesterolemia would all be considered factors that
			contributed to the death. However, they would not be in the direct causal
			sequence of Part I, so they would be placed in Part II. The surgery probably
			played a role in death but did not cause the coronary artery disease, so it is
			also listed in Part II.
