		<span class="section-paragraph">
			<p>A 34-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with severe shortness of
			breath. He had a 9-month history of unintentional weight loss, night
			sweats, and diarrhea. The patient had no history of any medical condition
			that would cause immunodeficiency. An Elisa test and confirmatory Western
			Blot test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were positive.
			T-lymphocyte tests indicated a low T helper -suppressor ratio. A lung
			biopsy was positive for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), indicating
			a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
			The patientâ€™s pneumonia responded to pentamidine therapy, and the patient
			was discharged. The patient had two additional admissions for PCP.
			Seventeen months after the patient was first discovered to be HIV positive,
			he again developed PCP but did not respond to therapy. He died 2 weeks
			later.

			<i>
			Notes on death certification:<br/>
			By definition, AIDS is due to HIV infection; even though it may seem redundant
			to specify HIV infection in the causal sequence death, it is desirable to
			do so. HIV infection and AIDS are not synonymous, and there is a variable
			clinical course between the time of HIV infection and onset of AIDS.
